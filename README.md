# sunset-alarm
a personal project to remind me to go walking few minutes before sunset everyday
this is the very first project i made in which i was not following a python tutorial
it's purpuse is to remind me to walk outside a couple of minutes before sunset(which i obviously don't do now because of the quarantine)
i use windows task planner to activate the script about a safe distance away from sunset inorder not to waste resources on my computer by running it all day. 
then i normally set the alarm to 25 or 20 minutes before sunset
sunset times vary on a week by week basis which is why i cant use my normal alarm to do this
